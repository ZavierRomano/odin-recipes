            <li>Baby Yukon Gold Potaoes</li>

    <h5>Steps To Cook</h5>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil</strong> the potatoes until they’re almost fork-tender—start checking them after about ten minutes. This is a job you could do ahead of time, because they’ll get cooked again in the pot with the chicken thighs.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown!</strong> Brown the seasoned chicken thighs in a little oil, so the skin gets brown and crisp. You can do this in the same pot you’ll use to braise the whole dish, FYI, but you might need to work in batches.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer!</strong> Tuck the chicken thighs, potatoes, garlic, shallots and lemon into the pot, pour stock over it all and get the liquid simmering.</li>
            <li><strong>Time</strong> to braise! Lid on, and into the oven! Braise for about 40 minutes, or until your meat thermometer says the thighs are done—look for a reading of 165°F.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish</strong> by adding a little butter and fresh chives to the pan to create a pan sauce from all of those gorgeous golden juices.</li>

        </ol>
